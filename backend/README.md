# Industrial Backend Infrastructure (Mainnet)

The core institutional clearing and settlement engine for the xend Philippines ecosystem, engineered for high-availability mainnet operations using FastAPI and enterprise PostgreSQL.

## 🏛️ Enterprise Specifications

- **Institutional Clearing**: Native multi-channel settlement for Maya Business, Security Bank, and global clearing partners.
- **Node Governance Engine**: Advanced backend protocols for managing industrial POS hardware and virtual merchant nodes.
- **Synchronous Ledger Sync**: Proprietary event-bus architecture for real-time atomic balance updates across the grid.
- **Multi-Currency Vaults**: Regulated PHP/USD/USDT (TRC-20) liquidity pools with automated clearing windows.
- **Cybersecurity Core**: Hardened JWT-MFA authentication, strict hardware-level device binding, and cryptographically verified webhooks.

## 🛠 Deployment & Grid Ops

### 1. Institutional Configuration
Initialize the `.env.production` vault with mainnet credentials. Ensure institutional API keys are encrypted at rest.

```env
ENVIRONMENT=production
MAYA_BUSINESS_MODE=live
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://[Institutional-Vault]
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=[Vault-Encrypted]
```

### 2. Manual Cluster Initialization
```bash
# Provision industrial dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Execute schema evolution
alembic upgrade head

# Initialize clearing engine
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 4
```

### 3. Mainnet Grid Monitoring
Monitor production cluster telemetry using Render dashboard logs or integrated Grafana boards.

Use Render's log stream for the `paybot-backend` service and validate the health endpoint in the Render dashboard.
