## 📦 Build Instructions

### Production Build
To generate the release APK for distribution:
1. Ensure `mobile/android/src/Config.ts` is set to the production URL.
2. Run the build script from the root:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./build_apk.ps1
```
3. Find the signed APK in: `mobile/android/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

## 🔐 Security
- **Device Binding**: Each session is locked to the physical device ID.
- **X-Device-ID**: Every request includes the unique device identifier for verification.
- **SSL Only**: Communication is strictly over HTTPS.

## Troubleshooting
- **Assignment Required**: If the app shows "Waiting for Assignment", the device must be linked to a user in the Admin Dashboard.
- **Connection Error**: Verify the `API_BASE_URL` in `Config.ts` is reachable from the device network.
